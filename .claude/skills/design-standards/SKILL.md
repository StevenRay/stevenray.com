# Design Standards

## Steven's Design Taste

- Bold over safe
- Character over generic polish
- Memorable over forgettable
- Atmospheric (gradients, noise, textures) over flat
- Typography with personality, not system defaults
- If it couldn't be mistaken for AI slop, we're on track
- Swiss Miss / Tina Roth Eisenberg energy
- Dyson functionality + emotional delight

## The Awwwards Allocation

How award-winning sites are actually judged:

| Category | Weight | What It Means |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Design** | 40% | Visual impact, aesthetic quality, art direction |
| **Usability** | 30% | Intuitive, effortless, users accomplish goals |
| **Creativity** | 20% | Originality, novelty, "has this been seen before?" |
| **Content** | 10% | Clear, meaningful, well-written |

**Target:** 70+ to be competitive. 80+ to win.

## Apple Design Award Criteria

- **Delight and Fun:** Is there magic in the interaction?
- **Inclusivity:** Works for different abilities, languages, backgrounds
- **Innovation:** Novel use of technology, not innovation for its own sake
- **Interaction:** Effortless, platform-native feel
- **Visuals:** Stunning imagery, skillfully drawn, high-quality animation
- **Social Impact:** Does it improve lives in a meaningful way?

---

## Before Any UI Work

Define the aesthetic direction FIRST:

1. **What's the ONE thing someone will remember?**
   - Not a feature list. One thing.
   - If you can't name it, the design has no soul.

2. **Which specific site has a similar vibe?**
   - Reference sites, not adjectives.
   - "Like Stripe's dashboard but warmer" > "clean and modern"

3. **What's the style?**
   - Be specific: brutalist, luxury, retro-futuristic, editorial, organic, industrial, art deco, maximalist
   - "Clean" is not a style. It's the absence of a decision.

4. **Is it bold enough?**
   - Could this be mistaken for generic AI output?
   - If yes, push harder.

## The Final Design Check

Before shipping any UI:

1. **Does it work?** (Dyson functionality)
2. **Does it serve the guest?** (Eames human-centeredness)
3. **Is it beautiful?** (Awwwards 40%)
4. **Is it novel?** (FWA innovation, 70+ to win)
5. **Does it delight?** (Apple/Swiss Miss emotional connection)
6. **Would it make Tina Roth Eisenberg smile?**

## UI Quality Gates

Before marking UI work complete:

- [ ] Matches defined aesthetic direction
- [ ] Not generic AI slop
- [ ] Responsive (mobile works)
- [ ] Loading states exist
- [ ] Error states exist
- [ ] Empty states exist
- [ ] Would score 70+ on Awwwards criteria
- [ ] Has that ONE memorable thing
- [ ] Typography has personality
- [ ] Color palette is intentional
- [ ] Spacing/rhythm feels considered
- [ ] Animations add meaning (not just movement)

## What "AI Slop" Looks Like

Avoid these tells:

- Default Tailwind colors with no customization
- Generic hero with centered text and gradient background
- Stock-feeling illustrations
- Predictable layouts (hero → features grid → testimonials → CTA)
- Inter/system fonts with no typographic hierarchy
- Flat, lifeless color schemes
- "Clean" that's actually just empty
- Animations that feel like demos, not design decisions

---

## What Good Looks Like

**Atmospheric:**
- Subtle gradients that feel organic
- Noise/grain textures that add warmth
- Layered depth, not flat cards
- Light and shadow that feel real

**Typography:**
- Display fonts with character for headlines
- Intentional hierarchy (not just size changes)
- Custom letter-spacing and line-height
- Type that could only work for THIS brand

**Color:**
- A palette, not just "primary" and "secondary"
- Accent colors that pop with intention
- Dark modes that aren't just inverted
- Color that sets a mood

**Interaction:**
- Hover states that reward exploration
- Transitions that feel buttery
- Micro-interactions that delight
- Scroll experiences that surprise

---

## Reference Energy

Brands/sites that capture the vibe I want:

- **Swiss Miss / Tina Roth Eisenberg** - Joy, craft, intentionality
- **Stripe** - Polish, clarity, developer-friendly luxury
- **Linear** - Opinionated, fast, beautiful defaults
- **Vercel** - Dark mode done right, typography-forward
- **Rauno Freiberg** - Personal sites with soul
- **Dyson** - Functional innovation that looks inevitable

## Style Directions (Pick One)

When defining aesthetic direction, choose from:

| Style | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Brutalist** | Raw, exposed, honest materials, bold type |
| **Luxury** | Restraint, whitespace, serif elegance, subtle animation |
| **Retro-Futuristic** | Neon, chrome, 80s sci-fi, high contrast |
| **Editorial** | Magazine-inspired, type-heavy, grid-based |
| **Organic** | Soft shapes, natural colors, flowing layouts |
| **Industrial** | Monospace, technical, exposed systems |
| **Art Deco** | Geometric, gold accents, ornamental |
| **Maximalist** | Dense, layered, everything happening at once |
| **Minimalist** | (Only if truly intentional, not lazy) |

*"Clean" designs that are actually just boring are a pet peeve. Push for memorable.*
